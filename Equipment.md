# Equipment
Most equipment is narratively described. Thrusting a dagger at a wooden door will surely be less effective than swinging a greataxe, but the greataxe is harder to conceal. The players and the GM use these kinds of attributes to determine position and effect.

## Equipment Prices
Your character starts with a limited set of equipment, but as they collect ingots they can expand their inventory. Use the following table of prices as a starting point. Armor degrades after use, but can be repaired between quests for one-half its purchase price.

| Equipment | Examples | Price (ingots) | Tags | Mechanics |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Basic weapons | Dagger, club, sling, or spear | 1 |
| Martial weapons | Bow, shortsword, mace, or battleaxe | 2 |
| Basic armor | Leather padding | 2 | | +1 Armor |
| Martial armor | Bronze cuirass | 4 | | +2 Armor |
| Heavy armor | | 8 | Loud | +3 Armor |
| Shield | | 2 | | +1 Armor |

## Crafting and Repairing Equipment
Between quests, you may wish to repair _Broken_ items or craft new ones. To do so, roll _Tinker_. Count the die showing 4-6. You can use that number of ingots in repair or purchase costs through tinkering. If your project can’t be completed in one downtime, start a clock with segments equal to the item’s cost in ingots. Fill in the appropriate number of segments.

**Example: Armor repair.** Rusty’s Martial Armor was depleted during his last quest. It would cost 3 ingots to have it repaired. During his downtime, he rolls Tinker. He has 2 ranks in Mind and training in Tinker, so he rolls 3 dice. He gets 2, 5, 4. He can cover 2 ingots in repair costs, and pay the remaining 1 ingot from his ingot stash.

### Crafting Beyond the Equipment List
If you want to craft something that’s not on the equipment list, discuss it with your GM. You can create a clock with a number of segments appropriate for its complexity.

## Item Tags
Some items may have special mechanics represented by Tags. A Tag is a single word describing some feature of the item. 

### Basic Tags
This section lists standard tags, you can work with the GM to come up with others where appropriate.
* Broken - This item is damaged and cannot be used until it’s repaired. Reduces an item’s worth by half.
* Consumable - Can only be used once.
* Dependable - When rolling to use this item, you can choose to roll a Luck Dice and add it to your pool after seeing the result instead of before.
* Loud - Conspicuous items. Trying to go unnoticed is at limited effect when you have this item on your person.
* Luxury - This item is fancy, and costs three times the normal price.
* Subtle - Negates the Loud tag.

Assigning Tags to items is difficult work. Basic Tags that are beneficial increase an item’s value to three times its purchase price. Adding a beneficial tag to an existing item requires covering the difference between the purchase price and new price.

**Example: Adding _Subtle_ tag to loud armor** Rusty’s Heavy Armor has the Loud Tag, and he wants to add the Subtle Tag to negate it. His armor’s purchase price is 8 ingots, so with the Subtle tag it will be worth 3 x 8 = 21 ingots. Rusty rolls Tinker between seven quests until his project clock reaches 21 - 8 = 13 ticks. His armor now has the Subtle Tag.

### Legendary Tags
Legendary Tags represent powerful abilities. You may find them in treasure hoards or special merchants, but they are exceptionally rare. Legendary Tags cannot be added to existing items.
* Nimble – When you use this item to Maneuver, treat your lowest roll as a 4.
* Resilient – This item has half the usual repair cost when Broken.
* Vicious – When you use this item to attack a creature, treat your lowest roll as a 4.
* Blessed - Gain a +1d bonus to prayers in the specified domain.
* Steel - This item is crafted from dwarven steel. Weapons gain +1d to attacks.
