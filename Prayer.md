# Prayer and Miracles
The Age of First Empires is a time of primal, meddling gods. The divine can no longer walk the land without dreadful consequence, but they have found other ways to bend it to their will. The devout pray for divine intervention, and their prayers may be answered with miracles. When you train Pray, you must choose a primary deity. A character can pray to any deity, but prayers to a deity other than the petitioner’s primary are made at a -1d penalty. 

## Divine Domains
All deities can answer prayers for any type of miracle, but each deity has a divine domain representing their area of focus. This provides flavor for your deity, and is the basis for the “Divine Devotion” stunt. When you choose your deity, work with the GM to choose their domain.

## Prayers
There are set categories of prayers that the devout may choose from, each can produce different kinds of miracles. Before rolling to pray, declare the domain of the prayer. Unlike other skills, with Prayer the GM does not set a level of effect. Instead, the player chooses a combination of effects from the result of their roll. The GM may propose alternative effects for a miracle or failure that are narratively appropriate.

Roll Intuition using the Prayer skill, and interpret the results as follows:

* Failure – The GM chooses one failure effect:
    * You are an imperfect vessel for divine power. Suffer two strain.
    * You pay the price for blasphemy. Suffer two harm.
    * Your prayers go unanswered. You cannot use this prayer domain again on the current quest.
    * Another situationally appropriate consequence.
* Mixed Success – Choose one:
    * Perform one miracle
    * Perform two miracles and suffer one failure effect
* Success: Perform two miracles.
* Critical success: Choose one:
    * Perform four miracles
    * Perform two miracles and gain a Luck Die

## Miracles
Each domain of prayer has a set of miracles the player can choose from. All miracles target a creature of your choice, unless stated otherwise. The petitioner can choose the same miracle multiple times, with the same or different targets.

### Aid
* The target’s next failure becomes a mixed success.
* The target suffers one less strain next time they Chant.

### Good Fortune
* Distribute luck dice equal to the number of hits to targets of your choice.
* The target gains double luck dice for failed rolls for the duration of the quest. A creature can only receive this benefit once per quest.

### Knowledge
* The GM answers a question honestly:
    * What here is magical?
    * What here is not what it appears to be?
    * What here can be trusted?
    * What here is undead?
    * Where will I find what I’m seeking?
* The target has a premonition that prepares them for the future, gaining a Luck Die they can use later.
* The target gains the ability to speak with and understand any creature that uses a language to communicate, for the duration of the quest.
* The target gains the ability to read the literal meaning of any written language they touch for the duration of the quest.

### Malediction
* Curse: Add a tag to the target that can be invoked by an ally.
* Sickness: The target is afflicted with a minor illness

### Repudiation
* You harm the target at limited effect. This miracle stacks to standard and increased effect.
* You destroy one undead _goon_.

### Restoration
* The target’s current harm is reduced by the number of hits.
* The target’s current strain is reduced by the number of hits.
* You remove one curse or physical trouble from the target.

### Shielding
* The target gains +1 armor rating for the duration of the quest. **[TODO: This must be changed with the new armor resistance system]**
* For the duration of the target’s quest, they cannot become lost.
