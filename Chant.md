# The Chant
Magic is still new and raw. Some creatures are innately magical, but for most people the only way to directly control magic is using an art called The Chant.

## Chanting Mechanics
Chanting has mechanics that are slightly different from other actions. If you decide to play a Chanter, use this section’s rules for constructing and resolving chants.

### Training in The Chant
Chanting can only be performed by characters with the Chanter stunt. Chanters have a personal Lexicon of words. Choose **five words for each rank in Mind** to add to your personal Lexicon. If you level up in the future and add another rank to Mind, choose five more words to add to your Lexicon.

#### Learning Specifiers
Specifiers are specific forms of more general words. For example, “plant” is a specifier for the more general “life”. Using “plant” to modify “life” would allow greater precision, and likelihood of success. To learn a Specifier, you must know its general form. You cannot learn the word “fabric” unless you also know the word “synthetic”.

### Constructing a Verse
The Chanter attunes to the magic around them, **determines their target** (an object, living thing, or location), **visualizes their intent** and firmly fixes it in their mind before uttering a word. Once they have done so, they must **clearly and loudly articulate a verse** using words they know. Chanting requires at least one free hand.

At the table, this means you (as a player) must **clearly state your target**, **intention** (attack, create an advantage, or overcome an obstacle), **and verse** using words from your Lexicon. All verses must include a verb. A target noun increases the likelihood of success, and additional targeting can be provided with a specifier. A verse cannot use only a verb and specifier – to use a specifier, the general noun must also be used.

**Example verse to mend a wheel.** A Chanter who wishes to mend a damaged wagon wheel may utter the simple “restore”, the clearer “restore synthetic”, or the even clearer “restore synthetic construct”. Each could work, but more specific verses have a greater chance of success. However, precision requires fortitude, and can cause more Strain.

### Resolving a Verse
When you have formed your verse, **roll one die for each word you are using from your lexicon.** Chant rolls are resolved the same way as other actions, using the maximum value rolled. If the maximum value is 1-3 the Chant fails, 4-5 it is a mixed success, and at 6 it is a complete success. On a Critical Success, you have the added option of removing one Strain (see next section).

The GM will let the story guide the consequences of imperfect chanting. You may miss your target, have reduced (or destructively increased) effect, suffer harm, or fail in a way specific to your current situation.

**Targeting:** You must have line of sight to your target, or knowledge of its precise location. If you have neither of these, you incur a -1d penalty. For most divination and conjuration verbs, this is an unavoidable challenge. 

**True names:** Every creature and object has a true name, though most creatures are unaware of theirs. If you have the true name of your target, your Chant can still fail but not by mis-targeting, even without line of sight or knowledge of its location.

**Bonus:** You can spend Luck dice to gain a bonus when Chanting, as with other actions.

**Exceptional targets:** Some targets may require exceptional power to manipulate. Attempting to “move” the moon, or “immobilize” the entire ocean would challenge even the greatest Chanter. Targeting exceptional targets like these may be desperate and with limited effect, at the GM’s discretion.

**Example: More verses to mend a wheel.** If you cast a simple “restore” on a wagon wheel, you would roll 2d6 and use the highest result. If you cast “restore synthetic”, roll 3d6 and take the highest result. For the more specific “restore synthetic construct”, roll 4d6 and keep the highest.

### Prepared Verses
Chanters can spontaneously construct verses using their whole lexicon, but it is more taxing (see “Strain”). A chanter may spend time memorizing and practicing verses before a quest begins to reduce this strain. A chanter can only hold so much in their memory. The total length of all their prepared verses cannot exceed the total number of words they know. A chanter can only prepare verses between quests. 

**Example: Preparing Verses.** A chanter whose lexicon contains “conjure”, “detect”, “element”, “fire”, “water” knows five words, and can prepare verses with a total length of five. They could prepare both “conjure element fire” and “detect element”, or they could prepare ”conjure element”, “detect element”, and the general “conjure”.

### Strain
Chanting is taxing, and longer verses are increasingly so. Chanters may suffer strain as a result. At five Strain, you incur a -1d penalty to Mind and Intuition actions. Strain cannot exceed eight: after eight, the Chanter begins taking one harm for each new point of Strain.

#### Strain from Prepared Verses
When chanting a prepared verse, you suffer 1 point of Strain for every 1 rolled (including on bonus dice), regardless of the overall result.

#### Strain from Spontaneous Verses
When you spontaneously chant a verse, you suffer 1 Strain plus 1 more point of Strain for each 1 rolled (including Luck dice), regardless of the result.

#### Strain from Ritual Chanting
If you can take one hour or more to rehearse the verse immediately before chanting it, you reduce any Strain incurred during this ritual by 1.

#### Strain from Ongoing Effects
If your verse produces an ongoing magical effect under your control (for example: animated dead, or a magical barrier), any strain incurred while casting is doubled. As long as you are maintaining an ongoing effect, you cannot clear any Strain.

### Restorative Magic
Some Chanters can perform restorative magic to heal injuries. When a Chanter uses a restorative verse on a living creature, the target’s harm is reduced by the number of dice showing 4 to 6. Resurrecting a dead creature requires a lengthy ritual with costly materials between quests.

## Grand Lexicon
The Grand Lexicon is the list of all known Chant words. Nouns that are in bold are general target nouns. The words indented below are specifiers. You can learn a specifier only if you have already learned its general noun.

### Verbs
* Conjure - Summon or create the target
* Conceal - Hide the target from notice
* Detect - Determine whether the target is present
* Diminish - Weaken or reduce the target
* Enhance - Strengthen or make heavier
* Immobilize - Lock the target in place
* Locate - Gain information about the location of the target
* Move - Reposition the target

* Rend - Cause the target to be damaged or torn apart
* Restore - Heal or mend the target

## Example Verses
These are a few examples of verses and their effects. Remember: a two- or even one-word verse can always be used to the same effect as a three word verse. The shorter verses are less likely to succeed but will produce less Strain.

| Verse | Example Effect | Penalties | Dice |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Conjure element earth | Produce a column of stone or a boulder. | Producing unseen earth incurs a -1d penalty | 2d6 |
| Move element earth | Reposition the stone or dirt around you | | 3d6 |
| Rend life plant | Fell a tree, kill a flower | | 3d6 |
| Diminish element fire | Put out or contain a fire | | 3d6 |
| Move element fire | Move flames from an existing source (a campfire) somewhere else (an unlit torch or angry bear) | | 3d6 |
| Conjure | Generic verse to produce a particular visualized item (for example, a lost top hat) | Assuming its location is unknown, -1d | -1d6 |
| Restore life | Heal physical wounds to a living target | | 2d6 |
| Restore life person | Heal physical wounds to a living person | | 3d6 |
| Detect synthetic force | Discover magical effects or barriers in the vicinity | When detecting something unseen and unfelt, -1d | 2d6 |
| Conjure synthetic force | Create a magical barrier | Producing something from nothing, -1d | 2d6 |
| Immobilize element earth | Still a tremor in the vicinity | | 3d6 |
