# Introduction
_Arvor: The First Empires_ is a game of bold sword and sorcery. Magic is new, mysterious, and dangerous – you won’t find the clear, scientific spells of later ages. The world is untamed as well, and threats lurk in every cave and crevasse. Most who journey into the wilds do not return. 

But you’re not most. You are an adventurer, journeying boldly into the wilds in search of something: knowledge, wealth, glory, or power. Embrace the risk! The only way your character’s legacy will live on into the modern era is if they do something worthy of a bard’s song.

This is a narrative-first game. When a mammoth is charging toward you, tusks flailing, does your character leap out of the way? That could be Maneuver. Do they launch a boulder at the beast before it can get too close? That sounds like Brawl. Do they wiggle a tasty leaf to tempt it? That’s probably Tame. Let the fiction guide your actions first and foremost.

## The Old World
A time before the Cataclysm...

A time when the great ancestral empires still reign...

A time of primal, meddling gods...

A time of burgeoning magic and baneful consequence...

In the Age of the First Empires, Arvor is partitioned between the great ancestral empires and the wild lands. The wild lands are home to what remains of the giants, dragons, and all manner of beasts. The people of the world are just learning to harness the latent magic that surrounds them, and embarking on quests to change the world to suit them. 

The cultures, geography, and technology of the era are described in the “Setting” section.
