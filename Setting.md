# Setting: Arvor's Age of First Empires
## Technology and Culture
### Metallurgy and Craft
The weapons, armor, and other equipment in Arvor are made of a combination of leather, wood, stone, copper bronze, and iron. Dwarven societies have access to steel, but it is rare and expensive.

#### Primacy of Bronze
Giants were already working iron before the first kynd walked Arvor. While the humanoid races eventually adopted the metallurgy techniques of the giants, they were behind in nearly every way. In addition to the giants’ millennia of practice, they also possessed the capacity to work metal at the high temperatures required for ironworking.

This changed with the dwarven development of bronzing technologies, also called “Moradin’s Boon”. This new alloy was stronger, easier to shape, and less prone to corrosion, giving the dwarves a literal edge over their gigantic foes and propelling their society forward. Seeing the giants as the greatest threat to all kynd, the dwarves spread this knowledge far and wide across Arvor. With the giants pushed to the fringes, the humanoid people began to use bronze weapons against each other. 

### Secrets of Dwarven Steel
In the first millennia of the Age of First Empires, dwarven high smiths received “Moradin’s Second Boon”: a series of metallurgical secrets enabling them to craft hardened iron alloys called steels. The dwarves have carefully guarded the secrets of steelmaking, and almost never share the knowledge or products with non-dwarves.

## The Tin Trade, De Facto Currency
Some civilizations have local currencies but there is no shared standard for coinage. The creation of bronze requires large quantities of tin, a metal that is difficult to find. As a result, tin has emerged as a de facto currency between societies. One-pound ingots of tin are widely traded on the inner sea. 

## Language and Writing
### Ethnic Languages and the Trader’s Tongue
Every ancestral group has a language family of its own, with mutually-intelligible regional dialects. Most kynd speak only the language of their ancestors, but the well-traveled often speak the Trader’s Tongue. As trade between societies became more common, a common pattern of pidgin language emerged between merchants. The Trader’s Tongue is a practical language with little room for flourish or rhetoric. There is no standard way of writing The Trader’s Tongue.

All player characters speak the Trader’s Tongue unless the player and GM decide otherwise.

### Writing Material
The humans of the South are short-lived compared to many of their neighbors. They lack the long tribal memories of the Elves, and the lasting stone tablets of the dwarves are laborious to produce. As a result, they struggled to codify their mores and history, and were among the last people to settle into civil societies. Recently, they began using the reeds on the river near the Lake of Ancestors to create rolls of light-weight fiber called papyrus for inscription.

This invention brought new stability to human settlements. The use of papyrus has spread to other river-side societies. The goblins of the west have become prolific producers, but the majority of non-human societies maintain their old ways. Dwarves use stone tablets, the gnomes use tablets of whatever material is near, orcs carve into leather, and the elves rarely write, preferring to pass down knowledge and traditions through speech.

## Giants and Kynd
Before the first elves emerged into Arvor, giants reigned supreme. Their societies developed technologies and rituals that would live on for thousands of years, long after the decline of giants. The first humanoid people of Arvor were terrorized by their enormous predecessors, and in many cases enslaved by them. As mountain folk in the north, the dwarves bore the brunt of this strife, but no kynd was spared. 

With the advent of bronzing technology, the dwarves were able to produce sharper, more durable weapons and begin to push back the giants. 

## Magic: The Chant
(Excerpted with permission from Pembroke’s The Unwoven: A History of Arvor’s Lost Arcana)

> Long before Arvor’s arcane magic was systematized and studied as a scientific pursuit, those who were sensitive to the presence of arcane power found ways to attune to the hidden ley lines and call upon its power. Due to the practice’s loud, often repetitive nature it was called The Chant, and its practitioners Chanters. (Here we have the origin of the more modern “enchant” and “enchanter”, though the Enchantment tradition is far removed from the ancient practice).
>
> The Chant should not be understood as a simple language to be learned and spoken. Chanting required not only knowledge of words, grammar, and precise pronunciation, but also absolute clarity and visualization of intent. Any lack of specificity or resolve could be absolutely disastrous for the chanter or their target. Even the most skilled chanters occasionally found themselves strained by routine practice – sometimes to the point of death. In many villages, the arrival of a Chanter was not celebrated. The Chanter (and later innkeeper) Padilla wrote of resting at a roadside inn, only to awake and find the guests and staff had hastily departed in the night.
>
> The last lexicons of The Chant were lost with The Cataclysm, and there are no known Chanters in Arvor today. Nonetheless, The Chant laid the foundation for further study and use of magic. Practitioners used their growing understanding to systematize other means of more precise, reliable arcane control, and the fruits of modern magic grew from its rich soil.
