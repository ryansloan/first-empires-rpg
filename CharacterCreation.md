# Character Creation
There are seven steps in character creation:

1) Choose an Ancestry
2) Assign Abilities
3) Choose Trained Skills
4) Define Troubles
5) Pick Stunts
6) Specify An Aspiration
7) Choose Gear


## Choose an Ancestry

Choose your character’s ancestry. In this age, each ancestral empire is relatively isolated and has a distinct culture. You start with a gift reflecting the culture of your homeland.

| Ancestry | Gift |
| ------- | -------|
| Dwarf | **Steely Secrets** - You have one additional armor rating. |
| Elf | **Communal Resistance** - When a creature you can see suffers Strain, you can spend a Luck Die to take some of it instead. Choose how much you take. |
| Gnome | **Tinker's Education** - After rolling any action targeting a construct, object, or machine you can spend a Luck Die to treat a failure as a mixed success.|
| Goblin | **Trickster's Talent** - On a critical success, you gain two Luck dice instead of one.|
| Halfling | **Fortune's Favor** - You gain two Luck dice at the start of each quest.|
| Human | **Nation of Generalists** - At character creation, you are trained in one extra skill. |
| Orc | **Animal Ken** - After rolling any action targeting a beast, you can spend a Luck Die to treat a failure as a mixed success. |

## Assign Abilities
Abilities are used to resolve actions when your character attempts something that has a risk of failure. Abilities represent the general capabilities of your character. Are they a physical powerhouse, or an alluring charmer? When you create your character, you have four ability ranks to assign. No character can ever have more than three ranks in a single ability. 

| Ability | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Body | Physical prowess. Used for feats of physical endurance, power, or agility. Also used to determine how much a character can carry.| 
| Charm | Force of personality and presence. Used for to influence or trick other intelligent creatures |
| Intuition | Awareness and attunement to the environment. Used for instinctive and holy acts. |
| Mind | Intelligence and knowledge. Used to perform intellectual feats, and to Chant. |

## Choose Trained Skills
Every new character is also trained in four skills. Skill training represents a specific application of a ability. For example, the Bluff skill is a specific application of the Charm ability. When you make an action roll, if you have a relevant trained skill you can add 1 die to your pool.

| Ability | Skill | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Body | Brawl | Use physical strength to attack or make another effort | 
| Body | Maneuver | Act with finesse, precision, or grace. Also used to dodge harm | 
| Body | Sneak | Pass or act undetected | 
| Charm | Bluff | Deceive someone |
| Charm | Compel | Persuade or intimidate someone |
| Charm | Fraternize | Socialize to make contacts or gain information |
| Intuition | Hunt | Track or trap a creature, or use a hunting weapon (like a bow) |
| Intuition | Pray | Petition a deity for a miracle. (See “Prayer and Miracles”) |
| Intuition | Tame | Control a beast or monster |
| Mind | Brew | Craft tinctures, potions, or herbal treatments. (See "Brewing") |
| Mind | Study | Investigate or research something |
| Mind | Tinker | Craft or manipulate objects or mechanical devices |

## Define Troubles
Troubles are descriptive attributes for a character, representing the challenges or negative traits that cause problems for them. They may be personality traits (“reckless”), feelings from their history (“wary of elves”), or lingering wounds (“lost a finger in the war”). Whatever you choose, the Troubles should be descriptive and relevant to gameplay. Work with your GM to make sure they’re a good fit.

Example Troubles: arrogant, dishonest, distrusting, faithless, gambler, haunted by the war, I never surrender, in debt (to whom?), loathes civilization, lost a finger in the war, naive, reckless, something to prove, tempted by knowledge, tempted by shiny things, uncouth.

## Pick Stunts
Choose two stunts for your character. Stunts are more specific than skills, and reflect a character’s specialized talents, training, or prior experience. See the “List of Stunts” section.

## Specify an Aspiration
Your character has some short-term aspiration. This should be specific enough that it will be clear when it has been resolved, attainable enough that you could complete it in two to five sessions of play, and ambitious enough that there’s some question of whether you can succeed.

| Good aspirations | Bad Aspirations |
| -- | -- |
| Discover the source of the village curse | Become an expert on curses (Why? Too vague. When are you an expert?) |
| Protect Clovis (party member) from the murder hornets | Ascend to divinity and rule over the realm (Why? Too unattainable, start smaller) | 
| Find out why Clovis is preternaturally drawn to the murder hornets nest | Eat a moldy potato (Why? Not ambitious enough…also yuck) |

## Choose Gear
Every character can carry three inventory items. For each point a character has in Body, they can carry an additional item. Ingots are not counted as part of gear. When carrying a fallen or unconscious ally, their body counts as one item. If they are carrying items themselves, you must also carry those. A group of the same type of concoction counts as one item, regardless how many you carry. You can carry one healing tincture just as easily as ten healing tinctures.

### Weapons
Most weapons don’t provide special mechanical benefits, but entering a physical fight against armed opponents without a weapon of your own will be at reduced effect. Your character starts with a weapon of their choice, probably a classic of their home empire. This can be a basic or martial weapon with no tags.

### Armor
A new character’s starting Armor depends on their ranks in Body. Characters with zero or one rank in body start with no armor, just clothing. Characters with two ranks in Body start with Basic Armor (1 armor, leather padding). Characters with three ranks in Body start with Martial Armor (2 armor, chainmail). Armor is described in the Equipment section.

### Ingots
You start the game with 2 ingots of tin. One ingot is typically enough to buy everyone in the tavern a drinks and dinner, or bribe a low-level lackey.

### Other Items
What else do you carry? Do you wear a dark cloak, or the colorful fashions of high society? Are you a tinker who’s always got tools? Work with the GM to determine what else (if anything) you carry. If you carry a set of tools for a single purpose (like a lockpicking kit), count the set as one item.
