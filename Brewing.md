# Brewing
Herbalists and alchemists know that the precise combinations of substances can have fantastic, and even magical, effects. They deliberately brew potions, poisons, and tinctures to aid them on their quests. But beware: the wrong combination of materials can be lethal! When you roll to Brew, choose a concoction from the list. If you want to produce an effect that is not in the concoctions list, discuss it with your GM.

The Brew skill can be used spontaneously (to quickly poison a soup, or quickly assemble smoke powder, for example). But brewing is a delicate act, and quick action without the proper materials produces unstable concoctions that must be used immediately, and could explode if the brewer slips.

## Careful Brewing
The Brew skill can also be used to create concoctions for later use. If you take one hour to Brew in safe conditions, the concoctions you produce can be stored in a vial for later use.

## Brewer’s Cache
If you are trained in Brew, you start each quest with a cache of concoctions. Before embarking on your quest, make a special Brew roll to determine how many concoctions you start with. 
* **Failure**: You start with no concoctions.
* **Mixed Success**: Choose one concoction.
* **Success**: Choose two concoctions.
* **Critical Success**: Choose three concoctions.

## Concoctions
All concoctions have the _consumable_ tag.
* Alchemical Aid – On their next action, the consumer has increased effect.
* Antidote – Cure poison.
* Healing tincture – Reduce current harm by one.
* Fire flask – Erupts into flames when broken.
* Poison – Poisoned player characters act with reduced effect. Poisoned enemies have a sticky tag that can be invoked for an advantage.
* Stimulant – Specify a ability when you brew this concoction. When the consumer rolls that ability specified they gain a +1d bonus. After rolling, they have a choice: incur 1 strain and the bonus persists to their next action, or incur no strain and the effect ends. A creature can benefit from only one stimulant at a time.
* Smoke powder – Create a cloud of smoke large enough to conceal an area.
