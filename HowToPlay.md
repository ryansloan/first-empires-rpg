# How to Play
In short: the GM sets the scene, you describe your character’s actions and intentions. If there’s a chance of failure, the GM may call for a roll. Choose the ability you feel is most relevant to your actions, and roll to resolve it. Don’t just choose your best ability and rationalize it. Using Study to attack? Maybe. But how?

Based on the actions described, the GM sets the position (possible negative results: controlled, risky, or desperate), and level of effect if it succeeds (limited, standard, great).

## Declaring Intention
First, specify the intended outcome for the action: attack, create an advantage, or overcome an obstacle.

When you **attack**, you are doing harm to creature(s). Any excess harm can be applied to another creature in the same zone.
* Example: stabbing the evil king with a pointy stick
* You deal harm equal to the number of hits.
* On a mixed success: you deal harm but suffer some yourself.
* On a success: you deal harm with no negative effects

When you **create an advantage**, you are improving the situation for yourself or an ally.
* Example: throwing sand in the evil king’s eyes so your ally can stab him
* On a success: choose one…
    * The **position** improves
    * You create a new **tag**, which grants +2d when invoked. A **tag** can be invoked a number of times equal to the number of hits.
    * You reduce a **danger clock** by the number of hits.

When you **overcome an obstacle**, you are circumventing something that stands in your way.
* Example: breaking down the evil king’s door (so you can eventually stab him)
* On a success: You **make progress** against the obstacle, either bypassing it or adding to its clock.

## Hits
A **hit** is a die showing 4-6. 

## Exploding Sixes: Critical Success!
For each die showing **6**, roll one more die. This is called _exploding_. The result of an exploding six is added to your pool of results. If a 6 explodes resulting in _another_ 6, that explodes too, ad infinitum. 

**Example of exploding sixes**
> Bonko has 3 ranks in Body, plus training in Brawl. When Bonko charges in to slaughter the vile skeleton army, Kai rolls 4d6, giving 2, 4, 6, 6.
> 
> Both of those sixes explode, so Kai rolls two more: 4, 6.
>
> The newest six _also_ explodes, so Kai rolls one more: 3.
>
> Kai's final pool is 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, 3, giving **five hits!**


## Position
Position describes the relative danger of your character’s action. Most of the time, you’ll be in a Risky position. But if you are at a disadvantage (you’ve been disarmed in a fight, or are outnumbered), or are attempting an action at great scale (using magic to demolish a building), you may find yourself in a desperate position. 

## Resolving Actions
Most actions are resolved the same way: **roll one for each rank you have in the associated ability**, and **add one if you are trained in a relevant skill**. If there are any **tags** you can invoke, add one die for each of those. 

Chanting uses different rules for gathering dice, described in [The Chant](Chant.md).

### Aspiration Bonus
If your action is related to your character’s current Aspiration, add one more die to your pool.

### Determining the Result
The highest die determines the result, as described in the table below. If you have to roll zero or fewer dice due to penalties, roll two and use the lowest. Pray has special rules for determining results, see “Prayer and Miracles”.

Failure’s not all bad. Every time you roll a failure (1-3), you **earn 1 Experience Point** (XP) and **two Luck dice**. Remember to write these down!

| Highest Die | Controlled | Risky | Desperate |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1-3 (failure) | A complication occurs. The position becomes Risky | A complication occurs! Suffer harm; the position is desperate; gain a Trouble |  Suffer serious harm; a serious complication occurs; gain a Trouble | 
| 4-5 (mixed success) | Yes, but: with minor complication | Yes, but: with minor complication; suffer harm. | Yes, but: with serious complication; suffer serious harm |
| 6 (success) | You do it! | You do it! | You do it! |

#### Mixed Success is Still Success 
It doesn’t mean your character did something foolish or stupid, and it’s certainly not a failure. It means the situation was complicated in some way: perhaps there was an unforeseen side effect, or perhaps the situation was just inherently dangerous.

This requires a mental shift from d20 based games. In a d20 game, Bonko the Barbarian charges into combat with a troll, rolling to hit. This resolves only Bonko’s action, and the troll also gets a turn to attack. If Bonko hits the troll, but the troll also claws at them, that’s not a failed action: fighting is just dangerous. In this game, only players get turns, so the roll for Bonko also encompasses the actions of the enemies, environment, and other hazards.

### Hitches
Before rolling, someone at the table may propose a “Hitch” using one of the player’s troubles. A Hitch represents a player’s traits, personality, or injuries causing problems. Anyone can propose a Hitch: the player rolling, the GM, or another player at the table. The player gets to decide whether or not to accept it. A player cannot accept a hitch and spend a Luck Die for a bonus on the same action.

If the player accepts the Hitch, they take a -1d penalty to the roll, and gain Luck dice based on the current position for use later. A player who accepts a Hitch in a Controlled position earns one Luck Die, two in a Risky position, and four in a Desperate position.

**Example of a Hitch**: Kai is playing Bonko, a Barbarian with the “impatient” trouble. Kai’s about to roll to fraternize with the guards at the palace gates. The GM has established the position’s risky – it may alert them that they’re casing the joint. Kai would normally roll 3 dice for this.

> GM: Kai, I have a Hitch to propose.
>
> Kai: I’m listening…
>
> GM: Bonko is “impatient”, and is getting bored of all this talking. 
>
> He’s ready to smash something, and risks lashing out during the conversation. You’re in a risky position, so that’d earn you two Luck dice for later.
>
> Kai: I like it. Bonko want smash! I’ll roll just two dice then.

## Harm
_“Clyde! Clyde! Got hurt and died!” – From Boblin the Bard’s hit “Clyde (Got Hurt and Died)”_

When things don’t go your way, you may incur harm. Injuries and penalties add up. At 4 harm, you gain a **trouble** reflecting a lasting wound. At 5, you incur a 1 die penalty. At 6 you’re unconscious. At 7 harm you’re dead. Maybe a bard will write a song about you one day.

**Wounds**: Wounds in the form of troubles that you gain from suffering harm are not cured by simply reducing harm again. They can be removed by abilities that remove troubles, or by treatment between quests.

**Lady Luck’s Final Judgment**: When you reach 7 harm, you may roll all your remaining Luck dice. Will Lady Luck intervene to aid you? If the highest die is 1-3, your adventurer has met their end. If it is 4-5, your adventurer remains at 6 harm, unconscious but alive. If you roll a 6, your adventurer is conscious with only 5 harm. If you roll more than one 6, your harm is reduced by one point for each six after the first.

### Resisting Harm
When a character suffers physical harm they can resist it. When a character **resists physical harm**, they **suffer 1 strain** and **roll Maneuver**. The harm they suffer is reduced by 1 plus the number of _hits_ rolled, to a minimum of zero. Resisting harm does not negate other ill effects.

#### Armor
Characters wearing armor are protected from additional harm. When a character with armor would suffer harm, they can instead deduct as much of the harm as they want from their current armor value. 

## Luck Dice
_“The magic of our realm relies on cosmic balance. Optimists would suggest that all bad luck is complemented by better fortune. Pessimists would remind you that you may not be on the receiving end of it.” – Sir Glastaff M. T., noted pessimist._

You gain two luck dice every time you roll a failure, or when you accept a hitch. Luck dice represent your fortunes shifting. When you spend one, describe how your luck turned around! You can spend Luck dice in the following ways:

**Gain a bonus:** Before you roll, you can choose to spend one Luck Die to gain a bonus. Describe your good luck, and add the Luck Die to your dice pool.

**Pay it forward:** You aid an ally by giving them one of your Luck dice. Describe how.

You also gain Luck Dice at the **beginning of each session of play**. At the start of each session, roll 1 die for each ability in which your character has at least one point. You gain a number of luck dice equal to the highest die rolled.

There are also Stunts which allow you to spend a Luck Die for other effects.

## Combat
Often, combat situations can be resolved quickly using narrative order: if the archer decides to fire on the guards from across an empty courtyard, there’s no need to break from the narrative into a combat subsystem. They should roll to do that. But some engagements may be more prolonged, either due to their scale or the strength of the enemies. For prolonged combat, there are three steps: determine readiness, establish the battlefield, and take turns.

### Determine Readiness
At the start of combat, all player characters roll Intuition. If the majority of the party rolls a 4 or higher, they choose the turn order. Otherwise, the enemies have the advantage: the GM determines the turn order based on the narrative, and combat starts in a desperate position.

### Establish the Battlefield
The GM describes the battlefield, and divides it into **zones**. Zones are an abstraction, not a precise physical measurement. Generally, characters in the same zone are close enough to physically engage with each other with a minimal amount of movement. Characters with ranged attacks can target enemies two zones away, assuming there is nothing obstructing the path.

**Example of Battlefield Zones**
> The evil king’s hunting lodge starts with a vestibule opening directly to the greatroom. The kitchen connects to the greatroom from a small side door, and the cellar entry is in the kitchen. 
> 
> Each room is a zone. Characters in the vestibule could fire arrows at the greatroom (the adjacent zone), but not into the kitchen due to the walls, and certainly not into the cellar. 

### Take Turns
On a player’s turn, they can take one action as described in Resolving Actions. During this, they can move to an adjacent zone, but this may place them in a more dangerous position. Enemies do not take turns of their own, the results of their actions are determined by the success or failure of the players’ rolls.

## End of Session Routine
At the end of each session, the players complete the following steps.

### Three Questions
At the end of each session, the players answer the following questions together. The players earn 1 XP for each “Yes”.
* Did we learn something new and important about the world?
* Did we overcome a notable obstacle, monster, or threat?
* Did we loot memorable treasure?

### Aspiration Achieved
Individually, each player determines if their character achieved their Aspiration. If they did, they earn 2 XP and define a new aspiration. If a player’s aspiration is no longer relevant, they define a new aspiration but do not earn XP.

### Character Advancement
Each player tracks their total XP from failed rolls, the Three Questions, and achieving their Aspiration. When a character accumulates 5 XP, they advance. They can choose to **train 1 skill or add one stunt.**

Alternatively, a character can save their XP until they reach 10 XP, at which point they **gain 1 ability rank.**


## Between Quests
In between quests, your characters catch up on personal business for a few weeks. They may do some crafting or brewing, but spend the bulk of their time recuperating. 

## Gain Troubles
At the end of the quest, each player rolls Intuition. If the highest die is less than or equal to their character’s Strain, the character gains a new Trouble based on something that went wrong during the quest. This Trouble can be used as a Hitch in the future.

## Recovery
Before starting the next quest, each character rolls Body, reducing their harm by the highest die rolled (minimum zero). Characters who forego other downtime activities (like Brewing and Crafting) can gain a +1d bonus to this healing roll.

Characters start quests with zero Strain.
